# Countries Database API

## :movie_camera: https://magdakok.github.io/React-CountriesAPI/#/

**My first React API that pulls and displays country data from restcountries.eu**
- built with hooks
- uses Context for dark/light theme and local storage to keep the choice
- Router library syncs URL with current country page

### Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
